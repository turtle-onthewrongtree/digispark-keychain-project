A keychain that has a digispark and a 0.91 i2c oled display (128Ã—32) ssd1306 and shows sentences in a cycle.
First sentence : you can
Second sentence : breathe
Third sentence : you are not here to fit in. You are here to rewire the scene 
The third sentence will be cut into 4 and shown in 4 lines.

All these texts are centered.
Each of the sentences will be shown for 7 min and 6 seconds.
And when the last sentence time is finished the keychain will go to a really deep sleep mode.

My keychain has a tactile switch too. That works with press models.
It has 6 press models.
1. If its pressed once while the display is in the 3 swntences cycle, it will go to the next sentence.
2.theres a pixel art that i want to be shown on the screen. I will send it to you later so you convert it to a format suitable for integrating into the code. If the tactile switch is pressed twice the pixel art will come up. The art will stay for 8 mins and then goes to deep sleep mode.

3. Pressing the button for 4 times will show the messege : 
I love you
Let it rip
It is shown in two lines. It stays for 10 minutes and then goes into deep sleep.

4. And if pressed 8 times it will show
With you,
always.
In 2 lines.
This will never turn off. And stays on until the device is powered off with the on and off switch.
5. A sentence : dont feel alone and hurt. I got your back.
I want this in two lines. The tactile switch should be pressed 5 times for this to come up.

6.
A sentence: your life was my lifes best part.
I want this in three lines. The tactile switch should be pressed 3 for it to show up.

And all these texts are are aligned to the keft.

Each time the power goes on and offf it starts from the beginig of the sentence cycles.
